# Local Docker Compose

From the repository root, run `docker compose up -d --build`, then open
http://localhost:8080. Docker with Linux containers is required.
Compose supplies defaults; no `.env` file is required.
The application container uses Docker's init process to reap orphaned agent
subprocesses.

To customize, copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repository root.
The `.env` file is ignored by Git. Shell environment variables take precedence.
`LATERDOG_HTTP_PORT` changes the host port and the default public URL.
Internal service ports remain fixed inside the shared network namespace.
`ENGINES` selects space-separated npm packages; an empty value skips installation.
The image also carries Grok Build, pinned by `GROK_VERSION` in
`deploy/local/Dockerfile`; Grok and Codex sign in from the app's engine setup
with a one-time code, no terminal needed.

For Tailscale Serve, set `LATERDOG_PUBLIC_URL` to your HTTPS URL and
`LATERDOG_HTTPS_HOST` to its hostname without scheme or path. Configure Tailscale
Serve on the host to forward to the chosen localhost HTTP port.
Keep the default `LATERDOG_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1`. Caddy refuses to start when
`LATERDOG_HTTPS_HOST` is set with any other bind address, so direct remote HTTP
clients cannot claim HTTPS semantics by supplying that hostname.
The hostname mapping preserves HTTPS
semantics for that host while localhost access continues to use HTTP.
Private tailnet webhook URLs are only reachable by callers on that tailnet.
Without `LATERDOG_HTTPS_HOST`, the bind address can be changed for HTTP access.
Only use HTTPS hostname mapping with a trusted local TLS-terminating proxy.

Sign in and pair a browser:

```sh
docker compose exec laterdog codex login --device-auth
docker compose exec laterdog node dist-server/laterdog.js pair
```

On Windows, `./dog.ps1` forwards arguments to Compose using the repository
directory. It respects Docker's selected context and `DOCKER_CONTEXT`.

Data and engine credentials persist in the named data volume. For an existing
volume, set `LATERDOG_DATA_VOLUME` to its name and `LATERDOG_DATA_EXTERNAL=true`.
Fresh installs create their volume automatically.

Update with `docker compose build --pull` followed by `docker compose up -d`.
Stop with `docker compose stop`. `docker compose down -v` deletes managed volumes.
