# later.dog harness server — hosted/self-hosted tenant image, and the
# later.dog Cloud Pro home machine (docs/cloud-pro.md).
#
# Build the renderer + the self-contained server bundle, then ship only those
# artifacts on a slim Node runtime. The runtime stage holds what changes
# rarely (Chrome's libraries, agent-browser and its Chrome), and each image
# adds its engine CLIs before the app files, which change with every commit:
# a code-only change rebuilds only the small app layers, so a pull downloads
# only those. The server keeps binding 127.0.0.1 inside the container (the
# loopback-trust invariant is the auth model); deploy/docker-compose.yml puts
# Caddy in the same network namespace to terminate TLS and authentication at
# the edge.

#   docker build --build-arg ENGINES="@anthropic-ai/claude-code @openai/codex" -t laterdog .
#   docker build --target cloud-home -t laterdog-cloud-home .
#
# HOME is the /data volume, so engine CLI logins (~/.claude, ~/.codex, ~/.grok,
# ...) and later.dog's own state (~/.laterdog) persist across container
# restarts.
