// Live calls: OpenAI GPT-Live as the voice, the bot as the brain.
//
// The voice design doc (docs/voice-mode.md) rejected speech-to-speech models
// because "they replace the brain". GPT-Live's *client delegation* does not:
// the voice model only runs the conversation — listening while it speaks,
// taking interruptions, filling the wait — and hands every real request back
// to the application. Here that application is the harness, and the request
// becomes an ordinary turn on the bot the person called, with its own engine,
// tools, memory and approvals. Nothing about the bot changes.
//
// This file owns the one server-side step: exchanging the renderer's WebRTC
// offer for an answer. The OpenAI key never leaves the harness; the renderer
// only ever holds the SDP answer and the media connection it describes.
