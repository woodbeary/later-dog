// Generic ACP (Agent Client Protocol) driver core — one JSON-RPC-2.0-over-
// stdio session runtime that every ACP CLI harness (Grok Build, Gemini CLI,
// …) rides. Modeled on t3code's AcpSessionRuntime + per-agent AcpSupport
// split: the protocol mechanics live here, the per-harness quirks (spawn
// argv, auth method, model catalog, sign-in check) live in a small support
// object. Adding a harness = write server/drivers/acp/<name>.ts.
//
// One live agent process per (thread, spawn contract): the ACP handshake
// (initialize, authenticate) and the native session are established once,
// and later turns prompt the live session directly instead of paying the
// full handshake per message. The pool mirrors the Claude driver: a session
// closes after LATERDOG_ACP_SESSION_IDLE_MS of quiet (default 10 minutes, floored
// by LATERDOG_ACP_SESSION_IDLE_MIN_MS default 10s), when the spawn contract
// changes, when the child crashes, when an interrupt's cancel goes
// unanswered, and on stopAll/dispose. A resume cursor left by an earlier
// session resumes through session/load|resume when the process had to
// respawn.
//
// ACP has no `turn/completed` notification: the `session/prompt` RPC *result*
// is the completion signal (it carries stopReason + usage). Permission
// requests arrive as server→client `session/request_permission` and surface
// as canonical request.opened events, answered fail-closed (nothing approved
// unless the agent explicitly offered an `allow`-kind option — option ORDER
// is never a security contract). session/load REPLAYS history as ordinary
// session/update notifications, so updates are double-gated: nothing emits
// before the prompt is sent, and `_meta.isReplay` updates are dropped. Session
// configuration is the exception: its live updates apply before prompting too.
