// "Start me again": the one exit code a server uses to ask its launcher for
// a fresh start. A server exits with it after a copied workspace's restore
// commits (Copy this computer here, docs/copy-workspace.md), and startup then
// installs the restore before anything else loads. Every launcher in this
// repo honours it through one restartPolicy:
//
//   - `laterdog serve` (cli.ts serveUntilStopped), which systemd, launchd,
//     fleet and a terminal all run;
//   - the container image's launcher (server-launcher.ts);
//   - the later.dog Cloud home's launcher (cloud-home-start.ts);
//   - the desktop app's supervisor, which starts its server again after any
//     exit (electron/server-supervisor.mjs).
//
// Anything else that runs `node dist-server/index.js` directly stays down;
// the committed restore installs at its next start.
