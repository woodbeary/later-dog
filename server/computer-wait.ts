// turn on one desktop — and every turn queued ahead of it — and starts on
// its own when they finish. Say that, name the holder as a bot running a
// thread, and keep the same words on every surface (chat chip, room chip,
// the gate's refusal) so a person who has read it once recognises it everywhere.
