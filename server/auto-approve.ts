// What the harness does with a provider's permission request.
//
// Nothing here decides whether an action is safe. Each approval level is a
// provider's own permission mode passed straight through (Claude `auto`,
// Grok `--permission-mode`, Codex `approvalsReviewer`, …), and a request that
// reaches this process is one the provider left for a person. The grants the
// app applies are Full access and the person's exact saved commands. Approve
// for me also allows a web search, and that is the one action the app itself
// grants. Questions never come through here: a bot's question always reaches
// a human.
