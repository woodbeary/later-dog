// A later.dog Cloud home is personal (docs/cloud-pro.md): only the owner's own
// devices connect, each with an admin session the Admin's signed pairing
// gave it. No pairing, sign-in or session without admin scope is minted or
// redeemed there (server/sessions.ts requireAdmin), and at every boot any
// that is stored is revoked: what it opened or wrote is nobody's from then
// on, and its key is recorded first, so no crash can ever make it the
// owner's.
//
// Before, every device carried its own key (v0.1.91), so a device the owner
// unpaired made the owner's conversations read as someone else's. Once, at
// the first boot of a personal Cloud home, and again after a restore, the
// keys named until then are settled, in two tiers:
// - adopted: every key that opened a conversation, wrote a line or answered
//   a card, except a revoked one. Its conversations are the owner's for who
//   opened them, their approval level and their folder (so the owner's rooms
//   and conversations keep Auto or Full, and their project folder);
// - proven: only a key with proof it was the owner's, an admin session
//   still paired, or one that answered a card (only the owner's devices
//   could, on a Cloud home). Only those feed lending, memory, recall and the
//   recent-work brief (cloud-lending.ts ownerOnlyConversation): a guest the
//   owner unpaired before is indistinguishable from an owner's old device,
//   so its lines never count as the owner's there.
// Routines fail closed: a routine's writer is the owner only with proof (the
// owner's key as its writer, the owner's fingerprint, #2023, a proposal the
// owner approved on its card, or a restore the owner started whose results
// conversation is theirs); every other routine is nobody's, and runs
// confined. What a revoked session opened loses its working folder (its next
// turn gets a private one), and its routines are paused.
