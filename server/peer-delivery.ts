// Delivery receipts for bot-to-bot messages: what actually happened to a
// send the moment the coordination/delegation tool returned, one receipt
// per recipient. The outcomes are the bot-facing half of the same honesty
// discipline SteerOutcome applies to steering — a tri-state that can always
// be answered truthfully, where an indeterminate send reads "queued", never
// "delivered":
//
//   queued   — accepted into a durable lane; the recipient's turn has not
//              started, so nothing has been delivered yet
//   injected — the recipient's turn started with this message (it may still
//              be running, or it may have run and failed)
//   failed   — not delivered; the detail says why
//
// The rule that overrides every other consideration: never report delivery
// that did not happen. A failed live hand-off may stay buffered for a later
// drain, but its receipt stays failed.
