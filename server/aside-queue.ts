// The aside lane: peer context handed to a busy thread's RUNNING turn.
//
// A peer send that arrives mid-turn used to degrade straight to the
// delegation queue — full work, later turn, no reply until then. When the
// engine running that turn has a mid-turn seam (Adapter.steer), the same
// words can instead be folded into the live turn at its next step boundary
// as an ASIDE: context the model reads and usually ignores. The person's
// lane keeps real steering (parent authority changes the turn's course);
// an aside never claims that authority, and the envelope says so.
//
// Durability follows steer-queue's shape (chat_followups rows, restore
// only what never dispatched) with one aside-specific rule: the row id is
// the messageId dedupe key, it is written BEFORE the seam call, and the
// injected line lands on the transcript with queueId = row id BEFORE the
// row is deleted. A crash in either window is then self-healing: restore
// skips any row whose transcript already shows its marker (the words ran;
// never replay them) and requeues only the rest. "indeterminate" seam
// outcomes count as injected for the same reason — the words may already
// be running, and running them twice is the one mistake this lane must
// never make.
