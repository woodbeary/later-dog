// A bot's memory on a later.dog Cloud home, as far as a lent Mac is concerned
// (docs/cloud-pro.md, "Let my Cloud use this Mac").
//
// MEMORY.md is loaded into every turn of a bot, its topic files and daily
// log feed recall, and the instruction files in its working folders
// (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .mcp.json, .claude/settings.json, skills) are read
// by its engine on every turn, the owner's lending turns among them. So a line put
// there by a conversation the owner did not write (a guest's chat, a room, a
// webhook run) would steer a turn that can reach the Mac. The harness's own
// memory writers already refuse such conversations (server/index.ts); this
// catches everything else, a bot writing the files with its own tools
// included:
//
// - while a turn that is not provably the owner's runs for a bot, that bot's
//   memory is "pending" (whatever the owner changed before it is adopted
//   first);
// - when the files change while pending, the memory is "changed by someone
//   else" and the bot's turns cannot use the Mac until the owner reviews it
//   in the Memory panel: one click, bound to the exact files they were
//   shown;
// - any other change (the owner's own turns, the owner's Memory edits,
//   upkeep and tidy) is adopted as the owner's;
// - a write the harness makes for the owner (trustedWrite) is adopted even
//   while such a turn runs, as long as nothing else changed the memory first.
//   A foreign write racing it within the same moment is the one case this
//   cannot tell apart.
//
// A change is judged by each file's type and content, a link by its target.
// It cannot stop a shell a guest directs from writing later (after the
// pending window), or from editing this record: a guest who can drive a
// Full-access bot on the Cloud already controls the machine.
