# Bring your own MCP servers

Open **Plugins → MCP servers → Add server** to give your bots tools from an
MCP server you trust. A server is one of two things:

- **Run a command** — a local stdio server. Add the executable, put each
  argument on its own line, and add any environment variables as `KEY=value`.
- **Connect to a URL** — a remote server. Paste its address and, if it needs
  a token, add it as a header (`Authorization: Bearer …`, one header per
  line). Most servers speak **Streamable HTTP**; pick **SSE** only for an
  older server that documents the `/sse` endpoint.

later.dog saves a new server switched off. Use **Test** to start the command
(or connect to the address), complete the MCP handshake, and see the tools it
advertises. Then turn it on. It becomes available to compatible bots on their
next task; no app restart is needed.

Tokens for URL servers go in headers, never in the address.

### Whop

In Plugins, find **Whop** alongside Gmail, Slack and the other apps and click **Connect**. The built-in card
uses Whop's official hosted MCP endpoint and opens Whop's browser sign-in;
no API key, local CLI or Composio connection is needed. After successful
sign-in and tool discovery it enables the connection. A cancelled or failed
first setup remains off and can be retried without adding another server.

Open **Bot access** on the Whop card to reach each bot's existing Access
settings. Bots set to use every enabled MCP server inherit the connection;
bots with an explicit selection must include its server name. The next task
uses the selection. Whop also appears in the **Connected** filter. **Disconnect** disables the connection and signs out;
the saved entry remains available to reconnect. Existing custom Whop entries
at the official HTTP endpoint are recognized rather than replaced.

Whop currently requests admin access across businesses your Whop account can
manage, and its own consequential-action confirmations still apply. See the
[official Whop MCP documentation](https://github.com/whopio/whop-mcp-server).
This is an optional connected tool, not a change to later.dog's subscription billing.

### Servers that ask you to sign in

Some URL servers take no token; they want you to sign in with your browser
(OAuth). When **Test** gets an HTTP 401 that points to the server's sign-in
details (RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, then the authorization
server's own metadata), the server shows **Needs sign-in** and a **Sign in**
button. Sign in opens the provider's page in your browser, which returns to
later.dog when you approve. The server then shows **Signed in**, and Test
lists its tools.

- **Which servers work.** The authorization server must support PKCE with
  S256. If it lets apps register themselves (dynamic client registration),
  later.dog registers a fresh app for each sign-in. If it only accepts an
  app registered in advance, add that app as described below. A 401 without
  sign-in details keeps the old message: check the address and headers.
- **Where you can sign in.** Anywhere you use later.dog: on the computer
  it runs on, or in a browser on another computer (My Cloud, a hosted
  workspace, a server of your own). See below.
- **Bots never sign in.** A server that needs sign-in is left out of every
  turn until someone signs in from this page. A signed-in server gets
  `Authorization: Bearer …` in place of any `Authorization` header you set,
  so every engine that reaches URL servers can use it.
- **Tokens are kept apart.** They live in `~/.laterdog/mcp-oauth.json`
  (owner-only), never in `config.json` or an API response, and are left out of
  workspace backups. They belong to the server's address: changing the
  address or removing the server drops them. **Sign out** revokes them when
  the server offers that, then forgets them.
- **Refresh.** A token is refreshed shortly before it expires. If the server
  refuses the refresh, the server goes back to **Needs sign-in**.

#### Signing in from another computer

On the computer later.dog runs on, your browser returns to it at
`127.0.0.1`. In a browser on another computer that address is your own
computer, where later.dog is not, so sign-in comes back another way:

- **Over https (My Cloud, a hosted workspace, a server behind https).** When
  the server lets apps register themselves, your browser returns to the
  address you are using later.dog at, at `/mcp-oauth/callback`, and the tab
  says **Signed in. You can close this tab and return to later.dog.** Nothing
  to copy. Whop works this way. The address is the server's public address
  (a Cloud or hosted workspace's own, a connected domain, or `LATERDOG_PUBLIC_URL`)
  when you are on it, or the https address your browser is on when none is
  set. If you reach the server at an https address it does not list, sign-in
  returns to its listed public address instead.
- **Otherwise, paste one address.** For an app registered in advance (it
  always returns to its registered `127.0.0.1` address), a server that will
  not register later.dog for your https address, or a server reached over
  plain http, the sign-in panel says: *After you approve, your browser shows a
  page that can't load. Copy that page's full address and paste it here.* Copy
  the **entire URL from the address bar**, paste it into **Redirect URL**, and
  choose **Complete sign-in**. The page that can't load is expected: it
  refers to your computer, while later.dog is on the server. No port
  forwarding is needed.

On the computer later.dog runs on, the same paste step is under **Signing
in from another computer?** for an SSH tunnel or a browser elsewhere. **Open
sign-in page** reopens the approval page if your browser blocked the first
attempt.

Keep the redirect URL private. Complete the flow in the same later.dog browser/session
that started it, within five minutes. Cancellation or logging out ends the
pending flow; a URL cannot be reused, and a return to the https address works
once, for that sign-in only.

#### Servers that need an app registered in advance

Corporate identity providers (Microsoft Entra ID, for example) and some
hosted servers do not let apps register themselves. Register an app with the
provider, then edit the server and fill in **Sign-in app**:

- **Client ID** of that app. With a client ID set, later.dog signs in as
  that app and never registers one.
- **Client secret**, only for a confidential app. It is write-only like a
  header value: kept in `config.json`, never shown again, and sent only to
  the authorization server's token endpoint (HTTP Basic, or in the form when
  the server lists only `client_secret_post`). It is never copied into
  `mcp-oauth.json`. Leave it blank to keep the saved one; **Remove saved
  secret** drops it.
- **Scopes**, separated by spaces. They replace the scopes the server
  advertises; add `offline_access` when your provider needs it to issue a
  refresh token.

After you save, the editor shows the redirect URI to register with the app:
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp-oauth/callback`, where the port is fixed for
the server's address. Sign-in with a registered app always uses that port; if
another program holds it, sign-in stops and says so. Changing the client ID
or the scopes signs the server out; a new secret for the same app does not.

### Example: give your bots web search

A good first URL server is You.com's search server, because the free profile
needs no token at all. Add a URL server with the address

```
https://api.you.com/mcp?profile=free
```

leave the headers empty, and press **Test** — the handshake completes and the
server advertises `you-search` (web search) and `you-discover` (a directory of
other MCP servers). The free profile is read-only and rate-limited to 100
searches a day; there is no key, so none is stored. Turn the server on and
every compatible bot can search the web on its next task — `you-search` results
arrive like any other tool result, through the approval cards.

If the free limits are too small, [you.com/platform](https://you.com/platform)
issues an API key with a higher quota and the `you-contents` tool for
full-page extraction. Add the same address without `?profile=free` and one
header line, `Authorization: Bearer <your key>` — the key is kept write-only
like every other header value. `you-research` (multi-step cited reports) is
served by its own dedicated server, `https://api.you.com/mcp/research` — add
it the same way, with the same header.

### Import and choose tools per bot

**Paste config** accepts an `mcpServers` JSON block, a server-name map, or a
single named entry — commands and URL servers alike, in the shape Claude Code,
Cursor and Claude Desktop write. Import is all-or-nothing, refuses existing
names, and adds servers switched off—even if the pasted config says enabled.
It does not install, execute or connect to them. Test explicitly, then enable
the servers you trust.

Open a bot’s **Tools → Access → MCP servers** to narrow the enabled global
servers offered to it. Existing bots keep all enabled global servers until you
choose a subset; switching them all off means none. **Use every enabled server**
restores the default, including future additions. Stop all of that bot’s running
turns before changing this selection; the next direct or channel turn gets the
new list. The list does not filter project-local `.mcp.json` files and is not a
shell sandbox. Individual tool approvals depend on the engine and approval mode.

### Servers with hundreds of tools

Some servers offer more tools than a model can usefully read at once: Whop's
lists 425. Claude Code, and Codex signed in with its own account, look tools
up as they need them, so they get every server whole, as before. Other
engines would read every tool's description on every message, and the
API-model engines stop at 128 tools. So for bots on API models, on Pi, and on
Codex with a ChatGPT plan, a big URL server shows up as three tools: one that
searches its tools, one that reads a tool's exact inputs, and one that runs a
tool by name. The search tool says what the server covers, area by area.

A server counts as big when it has more than 40 tools, or more than about
100,000 characters of tool descriptions (roughly where Claude Code starts
searching on its own). Smaller servers are listed as they always were. There
is nothing to configure. A bot's tool selection still holds: it can find and
run only the tools you chose for it, and an approval card names the tool
being run, never the search. A big URL server also gets 30 seconds to start
on a bot's turn, like the Test button gives it; command servers keep eight.

Known limits:

- **Codex with a ChatGPT plan, on Approve for me, asks about every call.**
  Codex lets a server's read-only tools run without asking, but here every
  tool runs through the one tool that runs them all, which cannot carry each
  tool's own read-only hint. Each Whop call shows a card, naming the tool.
- **Command servers are not searched yet.** Only URL servers are. A command
  server with hundreds of tools is still listed whole, and API-model bots
  refuse more than 128 tools in one turn.

### Which engines reach which servers

| Server | Claude Code bots | Codex bots | ACP bots (Cursor, Grok, Kimi, …) | API-model bots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command (stdio) | yes, through the result gate | yes | yes | yes |
| URL, Streamable HTTP | yes | yes | when the agent advertises `http` | yes |
| URL, SSE | yes | with a tool selection or a ChatGPT plan (Codex itself has no SSE transport) | when the agent advertises `sse` | yes |

A server an engine cannot reach is left out of that bot's turn with a note in
the server log; nothing else breaks.

## What a Claude bot sees, and the "Also use my Claude Code MCP servers" switch

A bot on the Claude engine gets the tools and instructions its owner gave it:
the servers above, its integrations (computer, browser, agents, phone), and
its own project's `<cwd>/.mcp.json`. By default it does **not** inherit this
machine's Claude Code setup — the MCP servers and claude.ai connectors in your
user or local Claude config, your skills and agents, your hooks, and your
personal `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Those were being mounted into every turn of
every bot (one measured desktop added 407 tools, ~10k tokens per model call)
and were reachable by the bot. Codex bots, by contrast, have always read the
MCP servers in `~/.codex/config.toml`, which is why the two engines looked
different.

If you want Claude bots to see your own Claude Code MCP servers too, switch on
**Also use my Claude Code MCP servers** at the top of Plugins → MCP servers.
With it on, every Claude bot also loads the servers and connectors from your
Claude Code config on every message; skills, hooks and the personal
`CLAUDE.md` still stay out. More tools means more tokens per message, so keep
it off unless you need those servers — the recommended way to give a bot a
server is still this page or the bot project's `.mcp.json`.

The switch drops the CLI flag `--strict-mcp-config` (Claude Code 1.0.60+)
while keeping `--setting-sources project` (1.0.122+). The environment variable
`LATERDOG_CLAUDE_INHERIT_USER_CONFIG=1` on the later.dog process remains the full
escape hatch back to the old launch: it restores everything, for every Claude
bot, until you remove it. The harness also picks the session's compaction
window with `--autocompact` (2.1.122+). later.dog reads `claude --version`
whenever it lists engines (app load, the Engines page, after an update) and
only passes each flag to a CLI that accepts it, so an older CLI keeps working
— without the controls it predates — and the Engines page shows an update
notice with the exact command. `claude update` clears it.

## When your organization manages MCP servers

If this computer is connected to an organization (Settings → Organization)
and its Admin turns off custom MCP servers, only servers whose name or address
is on the organization's approved list reach bots. Other configured servers
stay in your list, marked **Managed by** your organization, but bots do not
get them, and the "Also use my Claude Code MCP servers" switch has no effect.
**Paste config** is off, and **Add server** accepts only approved servers.
Nothing is written to `config.json`; disconnecting the organization restores
the list as you configured it. With no organization connection, none of this
applies.

Address entries are HTTPS only. The host is compared label by label, where
`*` stands for one or more whole labels (`https://*.example.com/mcp` matches
`https://a.example.com/mcp`, never `https://evil.test/x.example.com/mcp`),
and the path separately, where `*` matches anything.

Limits: a personal **Codex** engine also loads MCP servers from your own
`~/.codex/config.toml`, which later.dog does not filter. An organization that
must block those can allow only company models, or leave personal Codex off
its engine list. Company Codex uses its own separate home, without your
`config.toml`.

## Advanced: edit the file

The same registry lives in `~/.laterdog/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@example/notes-mcp"],
      "env": { "NOTES_TOKEN": "…" }
    },
    "docs": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer …" }
    },
    "corp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.corp.example/mcp",
      "oauth": { "clientId": "…", "clientSecret": "…", "scopes": ["api://corp-mcp/read", "offline_access"] }
    }
  },
  "features": { "claudeUserMcp": false }
}
```

`type` is `http` (Streamable HTTP, the default) or `sse`. `oauth` is the
optional sign-in app; `clientSecret` and `scopes` may be left out. If you edit the file
by hand, restart later.dog. Every bot whose engine can mount custom MCP
servers gets the enabled tools on its next task.

## Rules that keep this safe

- **Permission cards by default.** Custom servers are never pre-approved:
  on Claude their tools route through the permission broker into Allow/Deny
  cards; on Codex they keep the on-request approval policy; ACP engines
  relay the agent's own permission asks. Built-ins stay pre-quieted — only
  *your* servers ask.
- **Reserved names are refused** (`computer`, `agents`, `composio`,
  `browser`, `phone`, `dweb`, `laterdog`, …) so a custom entry can never shadow
  a built-in tool surface. Names are lowercase letters/digits/`_`/`-`, max
  32 chars, starting with a letter.
- **One bad entry never takes the fleet down.** Invalid entries are skipped
  with a logged reason; the rest still mount.
- **Credentials are write-only in the UI.** The API returns environment and
  header names, never their values. Leaving an existing value blank keeps it
  saved; removing its line deletes it.
- **Credentials stay off argv.** `env` values travel in the child
  environment (Codex argv carries env *names* only; Claude uses the private
  0600 mcp-config file; ACP passes them in the session payload with the
  wire log redacted). Header values do the same: Codex reads them from
  harness-named environment variables (`env_http_headers`), Claude from the
  0600 file. They do persist as plaintext in the 0600 config file — prefer
  tokens scoped to the one server. Codex gives its MCP servers their
  variables from the same environment it runs the bot's shell commands in,
  so each variable a server needs there is excluded from that shell; a value
  you already had in your own environment, like a proxy setting, stays.
- **Proxies: https only.** Where later.dog's own remote proxy connects to
  a URL server, an `https://` server goes through your `HTTPS_PROXY` /
  `HTTP_PROXY` (CONNECT), with this computer's loopback names always added
  to `NO_PROXY` (`[::1]` included). An `http://` server is reached directly,
  with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=0` even where your environment turns it on:
  Node 24's fetch hangs on a plain http request sent through an environment
  proxy.
- **Testing is bounded.** A command is stopped after the handshake (or eight
  seconds), its output is capped, and its stderr is never sent to the UI. It
  inherits none of later.dog's workspace or provider credentials; only the
  environment variables configured for that MCP server are added. A test
  reads at most 32 MB (Whop's tool list alone is 1.2 MB), and a URL test
  reports only the HTTP status of a refusal.
- **Addresses are checked.** A URL server needs a full `http://` or
  `https://` address with no credentials in it; header names must be valid
  HTTP field names and values a single line.
- **The result gate covers commands.** Oversized tool results from a stdio
  server are trimmed before they reach the model (`LATERDOG_MCP_RESULT_BUDGET`).
  A URL server is contacted by the engine itself, so there is no process to
  stand between; its results arrive untrimmed.
- `"enabled": false` parks an entry without deleting it.
