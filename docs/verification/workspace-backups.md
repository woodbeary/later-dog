# Full workspace backups

## User path

There is no Backups page in Settings. An admin can still export and import
through the HTTP routes in `server/workspace-backup-http.ts`: export writes an
encrypted `.dogbackup` behind a password; import uploads it, checks the
password and returns a validated preview, and stages the replacement only
after an explicit `REPLACE` confirmation. It is replacement, not an additive
team import. The restore applies when the server restarts; no restore writes
into a running Store. A browser that started a restore from the old Backups
page still gets the recovery screen: **Restart and restore** on the local
desktop, or **Retry** once a hosted server has restarted.

The previous workspace is retained under `.backups/safety-<restore-id>/data`.
Keep this copy until the restored workspace is checked. Do not publish it.
The downloaded archive is encrypted; private staging and safety directories
are not. They contain private workspace data and require normal host/disk
protection. The latest successful restore's staging is retained for recovery.

Saved account credentials and connections are not transferred. Reconnect on a
new machine; existing credentials and connections on the destination remain
unchanged. Conversations, drafts and user files are not automatically redacted
and may still contain pasted secrets, so the archive must remain private.

## Launch and drive

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/verify-workspace-backup.ts
```

This recipe accepts no live URL. It launches two owned fake-engine servers with
temporary data and homes, creates a real conversation, profile, memory, reviewed
skill and attachment, exports via the real HTTP route, uploads to the second
workspace, validates and confirms replacement, then restarts that exact fixture.
It compares original IDs, history, attachment bytes and app-managed paths, saved
non-secret settings, credential exclusion and destination preservation,
browser-state allowlisting, and the automatic safety copy. It sends a new turn
through the restored conversation. Wrong passwords, wrong confirmation,
non-admin access and post-confirmation writes are rejected.

Keep its JSON output and the reported persistent log/evidence paths. The
permanent version is:

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/workspace-backup-workflow.test.ts --silent=false
```

## Additional checks

Export worker behavior and repeatable latency measurements are documented in
[Backup responsiveness](backup-responsiveness.md).

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/workspace-backup.test.ts \
  server/workspace-backup-policy.test.ts \
  server/workspace-backup-http.test.ts \
  server/workspace-backup-maintenance.test.ts \
  server/webhook-ingress.test.ts server/request-auth.test.ts
```

The archive tests cover authenticated encryption, damaged/wrong-password files,
path traversal, links and duplicate entries, SQLite WAL rows, modified staging,
cross-directory path repair, interrupted replacement, credential exclusion,
destination credential preservation and recovery. The maintenance checks keep
ordinary requests, turns, schedulers and the separate webhook receiver from
writing during a snapshot.
Unknown external writers cannot be frozen: users must stop external editors and
managed desktops before exporting.

All tests use disposable workspaces and synthetic credential values, never the
user's keychain or live sign-ins. Actual archive and restart behavior is
proved by the two-server recipe above.

## Limits and cleanup

Backups include this workspace's durable files and complete message records—not
saved account credentials/connections, remote VM disks, other workspaces, external
project files, external CLI/browser login homes, or live device sessions. The
10 GB and 100,000-entry limits fail visibly. Scheduled routines/webhooks are paused and
unfinished work is not replayed after restore. Known temporary sockets, leases,
tool downloads and caches are excluded, as are the Organization library's
downloaded catalog and release files (`org-library/catalog.json`,
`org-library/blobs/`); unknown special files are rejected.
If a configured provider login home is inside ordinary workspace files rather
than the excluded `providers/` directory, export and restore refuse to proceed
until that login storage is moved outside the backed-up files.

Both recipes stop only their owned processes and remove only their temporary
workspaces. Evidence logs remain. These tests do not prove real cloud accounts,
external providers, phone recovery or OS-specific file-picker appearance. Saved
credentials are deliberately not transferred. No live mutation is part of this
recipe.
