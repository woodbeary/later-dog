# MCP sign-in from another computer

Run the focused unit tests and API tests:

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/mcp-oauth.test.ts server/mcp-oauth-discovery.test.ts server/mcp-oauth-store.test.ts server/mcp-probe.test.ts src/lib/mcp-sign-in.test.ts src/components/McpServersPanel.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run server/index.test.ts -t 'MCP OAuth|OAuth URL MCP'
```

Run the real MCP settings panel against a disposable fake-engine workspace:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/verify-mcp-sign-in.ts
```

The fixture uses `launchVerificationServer` and the existing isolated Vite
preview. It runs Doctor against that exact server, creates one synthetic MCP
server, and pairs an admin browser. It never contacts the user's running app,
reads their OAuth credentials, or signs into a real provider.

The browser tools follow the existing `control-laterdog ui` setup: set
`LATERDOG_AGENT_BROWSER_PATH` and `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to reuse installed
binaries, or let the fixture install the pinned tools. Set
`LATERDOG_UI_EVIDENCE_DIR` to choose the screenshots directory (default:
`.laterdog-scratch/mcp-oauth-evidence`).

The fixture verifies:

- A proxied admin session can start a flow.
- A blocked popup still leaves the reopen button and paste-back instructions.
- An invalid URL shows an error without consuming the pending flow.
- A delayed token exchange keeps the submit button disabled and spinning,
  preserves the pasted URL, and shows the result after the provider responds.
- Cancelling during that exchange immediately enables a new sign-in, whose
  paste form stays usable before the cancelled request settles.
- Pasting the fake provider's redirect completes the real PKCE exchange.
- The signed-in MCP server returns tools on Test.
- Logging out cancels the next pending flow and closes its listener.

The synthetic OAuth provider speaks loopback HTTP. A fixture-only route
substitutes an HTTPS approval link in the start response so the renderer's
HTTPS-only link check remains intact. Browser popups are deliberately blocked;
the fixture obtains the fake provider's redirect without following it and
pastes it through the real UI. This proves the headless completion flow, not
compatibility with a particular live OAuth provider.

Unit/API tests additionally cover owner isolation, replay, duplicate parameters,
wrong origins/ports/paths/states/issuers, expiry, cancellation during registration
or code exchange, and the existing automatic loopback callback.
