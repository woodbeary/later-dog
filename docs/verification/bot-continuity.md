# Bot setup, model scope, and file continuity

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/setup-mode.test.ts server/bot-setup.e2e.test.ts server/bot-continuity.e2e.test.ts server/independent-threads-api.test.ts
LATERDOG_UI_E2E=1 pnpm exec vitest run scripts/testing/control-laterdog-ui.e2e.test.ts
pnpm exec electron scripts/smoke-approval-modes.cjs --model-ui-only
```

The server recipe launches the real app in a temporary home with only the
offline CLI. It sends actual messages through `control-laterdog`, waits for settled
turns, and checks the prompt and model delivered to the provider boundary:

- A named bot with no description or SOUL can receive a normal work request
  without the setup interview or its "Wait for a yes" instruction.
- `/setup Help me track garden watering` explicitly enables coaching; the next
  ordinary request disables it, even if no profile card was confirmed.
- A pinned thread's model change with `updateBotDefault: true` updates that
  thread and the bot default used by groups and future threads. It does not
  change a selected sibling, other saved model choices, or approval levels.
- Without that flag, only the selected thread changes. Group dispatch still
  uses the bot default. Busy group changes and invalid requests are rejected.
- Direct and room prompts carry the same saved identity and standing rules,
  plus explicit current/shared/sibling file locations. Old files are retained;
  working-directory pins and concurrent-thread isolation do not change.

The test prints a retained `.bot-continuity.json` evidence path with commands,
wait results, bounded transcripts, and provider-input receipts. Launch
environments and MCP tokens are not retained. The renderer recipe opens the
real model picker, checks that it offers no scope choice, saves a screenshot,
changes models and back, checks that the bot default and the thread moved
together without changing the approval level, and sends a message through the
composer.

The picker has no scope choice: an owner's pick is also the bot default, and
every thread that uses the bot's model moves with it. The desktop model-switch
recipe uses the real picker and private approval channel against offline
providers. It checks Cancel, then switches a Custom Codex bot to its Claude
account in one confirmed operation: the bot default, the selected thread and
another thread that uses the bot's model all move to Claude with Heel. It also
checks the 390px confirmation layout, and that the picker fits at 1280×800,
1000×600, 800×480 and 390×844 with its effort row inside and room for two
model rows. HTTP cannot bypass Custom; ordinary Full switches may use the
atomic HTTP downgrade. A fresh thread adopts the new default, and a sample
engineering-handoff request sent through the composer completes with the fake
provider reply. Screenshots stay in
`.laterdog-scratch/verify-evidence/model-switch/`. This proves settings and turn
dispatch, not the quality of a real model's engineering output. The store test
also simulates a failed disk write and confirms neither scope changes.

The picker smoke also includes an installed but signed-out Claude account and
a missing Codex installation. The signed-out account stays in the picker's
account list as **Not signed in**; choosing it says it needs to be set up and
offers **Set up**, never its cloud models. The missing Codex, which no bot
uses, is left out of the picker. A missing engine that a bot already runs on
stays in that bot's picker with its install card, so the model never silently
vanishes. `src/lib/engine-rail.test.ts` covers these rules for each Claude
account, empty catalogs and leaving the source catalog unchanged.
`src/components/ModelPicker.interaction.test.ts` opens the real picker
component through **Set up** and checks the sign-in and install cards, that no
cloud model can be picked on a signed-out account while its local models still
can, and that opening local models re-probes local servers behind a **Looking
for local models…** status that ends after five seconds at most. The smoke
selects a configured local Codex model, browses Claude, closes and reopens the
picker, and checks that the selected local model is visible again.

### Signed-out Claude in the picker — 2026-09-26

After a Discord report that Claude could no longer be selected, the picker was
checked in the headless renderer (`control-laterdog ui launch`, a Vite preview and
a headless browser on a disposable fixture; no Electron, no real account):

```sh
FAKE_CLAUDE_AUTH=out node --experimental-strip-types scripts/control-laterdog.ts ui launch --mode not-logged-in
```

The fake CLI answers `auth status` with `loggedIn: false` and every prompt
with Claude's own "Not logged in" frame. Pepper is on that Claude.

- Opening the picker shows **Claude** on the rail with **Sign-in required**,
  the **Sign in to Claude** card and **Use a local model**; no Claude model row
  is offered. Before this fix the filter returned no engine at all for this
  fixture; that reproduction is now a test in `src/lib/engine-rail.test.ts`.
- **Use a local model** sent one `POST /api/instances/claude/refresh-models`
  and showed **Looking for local models…** (held for three seconds by delaying
  that request in the page), then **No local models found**.
- Sending `hello` on the signed-out Claude ends in the existing setup error
  with the **Sign in to Claude** card, not a silent failure.
- Two more accounts were added through `POST /api/instances/claude-accounts`.
  **Spare** and Pepper's own account were then pointed at a missing CLI with
  `PATCH /api/instances/:id`. The picker kept Pepper's account with its
  install card and the CLI-not-found reason, kept the signed-out, unused
  **Work** account (choosing it showed its sign-in card and did not change
  Pepper's model), and left **Spare** out.
- The browser console had no errors.

This proves the renderer and the fixture server's instance catalog. It does
not prove a real Claude Code sign-in, a real Ollama or LM Studio server, or
the Electron shell, and it is not a production qualification. The Electron
picker smoke's assertions were updated for these rules but were not run for
this change.

The screenshots from this run, removed from the repository on 2026-10-08,
showed Pepper's signed-out Claude in the picker, local servers re-probed when
local models open, and Pepper's Claude with a missing CLI keeping its install
card.

## Live Claude smoke — 2026-09-12

Separately, the exact system prompts captured from the disposable app were
replayed to the signed-in Claude CLI (Sonnet 5). These were synthetic requests,
not live user conversations. `--safe-mode`, `--restricted`,
`--strict-mcp-config` and `--no-session-persistence` disabled customizations and
saved sessions. Tools were disabled except for the final test, which allowed
only Read inside the disposable working directories.

| Request | Observed response |
| --- | --- |
| `What is 17 + 25? Answer with the number.` | `42` |
| Explicit setup for tracking garden watering | Asked about the job, timing, apps and folder |
| Find `garden-plan.txt` from earlier work, outside the current directory | Read the shared-bot file and returned its hidden verification code, `MOSS-42` |

An arithmetic control using the old automatic-setup block also answered `42`.
This does **not** reproduce every reported refusal, establish malicious intent,
or prove every provider behaves identically. The verified regression is the
unrequested coaching sent by later.dog; live results confirm ordinary work, explicit
setup and cross-folder reading on the tested Claude model. Group model routing
and UI persistence use the offline provider. No real bots or files were moved.
