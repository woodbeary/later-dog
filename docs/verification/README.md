# Verifying later.dog

later.dog has one development control surface: `pnpm control:laterdog`. It is a
thin command-line adapter over `scripts/mcp-server.ts`, so verification uses
the same URL validation, task pinning, bounded transcripts, wait states, and
redaction as external MCP clients.

## Launch

Start a fixture in one terminal:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/control-laterdog.ts launch
```

Run the foreground launcher directly rather than through `pnpm`; this ensures
it receives Ctrl-C and can stop its child before removing the temporary data.

It gives the child a temporary data directory and home, chooses a free
harness/webhook port pair, installs only the repository's fake engine, prints
the URL, PID, data directory, and persistent log path, then stays attached to
that exact child. The parent shell and the user's later.dog data are
untouched. Only `FAKE_CLAUDE_*` variables cross from the launcher's
environment into that child, so a recipe can script the fake engine's mode,
replies and tool calls without writing a wrapper CLI. Live calls add one
exception: `LATERDOG_OPENAI_LIVE_URL` crosses when it is a loopback
`http://127.0.0.1:PORT` (the fake GPT-Live that
`node --experimental-strip-types server/testing/fake-openai-live.ts` prints),
and `LATERDOG_OPENAI_LIVE_KEY` crosses only with it, so that key can only ever
reach the fake.

Pass the printed URL explicitly from a second terminal:

```sh
pnpm control:laterdog doctor --url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
```

Mutating commands refuse silent port discovery. This prevents a verification
recipe from sending messages to the user's running app by accident.

`control-laterdog ui` ([Chat UI, driven headlessly](chat-ui.md)) drives the real
renderer in a headless Chrome by accessible name, so composer sends, transcript
rows, tool chips and server feature flags are provable from the command line.
Other renderer-only behavior—Settings, sidebar drag-and-drop, the VM modal, the
built-in browser panel, and updater UI—is still not proven by the harness. Use
the relevant Electron/package smoke test and state that limitation. Add a map
entry only after the shared control surface can really drive it.

The [MCP sign-in fixture](mcp-sign-in.md) checks remote sign-in, callback URL
paste-back, MCP tools and logout cancellation through the real settings panel
and a synthetic OAuth provider in a disposable workspace.

The [Whop fixture](whop.md) checks its one-click setup, cancellation, denied
consent, discovery failures, reconnect and disconnect using that same registry
and a synthetic provider, without accessing a real Whop account.

The [Connected Apps OAuth fixture](connected-apps-oauth.md) checks blocked-popup
recovery, safe authorization links and abandoned-account retries through real
renderer components and isolated HTTP routes.

The [desktop server connection smoke](desktop-server-connection.md) mounts the
real Settings connection component in disposable Electron windows.

The [loading screen and tray smoke](startup-tray.md) checks the startup close
button, hidden handoff, tray restore, and Quit in a disposable Electron profile.

The [optional organization connection smoke](organization-settings.md) checks
the real Settings panel and production desktop client against a synthetic
Admin server, including cancellation, revocation and unchanged normal startup.

The [personal Cloud account smoke](cloud-account.md) checks optional browser
sign-in, server-verified Pro status and sign-out in a disposable Electron profile.

The [embedded server recovery smoke](desktop-server-recovery.md) crashes real
Electron-owned fixture servers, verifies bounded recovery and private access,
and proves quit cancels recovery without replaying an interrupted fixture turn.

The [Tailscale discovery fixture](tailscale.md) checks standalone macOS CLI mode
and HTTP tailnet endpoint refresh without touching a real Tailscale installation.

The [external runtimes recipe](external-runtime.md) proves a bot's standing
comms capability from `external-runtimes.json` against a disposable server and
the fake engine: scope, on-demand token reads, and immediate delegation drain.

The [cloud preview fixture](cloud-preview.md) mounts the real Computer panel
against an isolated server for image decoding, loading, and recovery UI checks.

The [VPS recovery fixtures](vps-recovery.md) reproduce preview/startup contention
and Docker-over-SSH timeout cleanup without contacting a real server.

The [live browser fixture](browser-live.md) mounts the real Browser panel with
an explicitly selected native engine and Chrome in a disposable home, covering
watching, takeover, input, and profile switching.

The [Local VM resume fixture](local-vm-resume.md) checks idle stop, restart
recovery, guarded resume and the stopped-to-ready Computer panel flow.

The [local computer launch regression](local-computer-launch.md) starts the
host CUA gate through real Electron in a disposable home, without opening the
desktop app or controlling the user's computer.

The [remote desktop viewer fixture](desktop-viewer.md) checks the bundled
noVNC page, authenticated WebSocket proxy, desktop input, reconnect and logout
against an isolated server, synthetic desktop and VPS SSH forward.

The [bot settings fixture](bot-settings.md) checks profile saves, standing
instructions, history restore, skill/memory refresh, and stale-response isolation.

The [hosted Slack management fixture](hosted-slack-management.md) checks the
agent settings link to Admin: hosted-only availability, the member-readable
route module, and stale-response isolation.

The [rich tables fixture](rich-tables.md) checks Markdown tables and message-scoped
CSV/TSV previews, large-file virtualization, sorting, search, export and keyboard
interaction in a disposable workspace.

The [people invitation fixture](people.md) checks hosted workspace sign-in,
roles and device revocation through the real HTTP API with a stubbed email
service. It does not drive the People settings UI through `control-laterdog`.

The [sidebar fixture](sidebar.md) checks archive and delete confirmations, their
default focus, keyboard wrapping and focus return against two disposable bots.

The [sidebar attention geometry fixture](sidebar-attention.md) measures the
Active Threads popover's width and inset at each expanded sidebar density in a
headless Electron window, including the compact-density case where the menu
used to cross the window's left edge and lose its title.

The [avatar provider fixture](avatar-providers.md) checks image-provider settings,
keyless local generation, saved-key handling, and safe errors with a local fake API.

The [independent threads fixture](threads.md) checks nested sidebar navigation,
per-thread models, simultaneous direct conversations and thread-scoped Stop.

The [mobile generated-image checks](mobile-generated-images.md) cover native image
attachments and message-scoped download authorization using isolated fixtures.

The [guarded external messages fixture](guarded-messages.md) checks atomic
branch and approval preconditions, retry receipts, and refusal to queue or
steer messages from external interfaces. It also verifies bounded request
lineage snapshots, Chief continuations and exact-execution Stop without
interrupting a newer request.

The [right-to-left fixture](bidi.md) checks per-block direction in bot replies
and per-line direction in sent turns, with code pinned left-to-right.

The [routines fixture](routines.md) checks confirmed proposals, manual and
scheduled runs, central run logs, List/Calendar views, and bot-scoped routines
using the real renderer and an isolated fake-engine server.

The [interval restrictions recipe](interval-restrictions.md) checks weekday and
time-window limits on scheduled routines in that same disposable fixture.

The [server settings recipe](server-settings.md) checks browser provider sign-in
with an offline CLI and custom-domain validation without touching live accounts.

The [engine library fixture](engines-ui.md) checks onboarding and Settings cards,
responsive layouts, theme contrast, and status refreshes without losing drafts.

The [Claude account recipe](claude-account.md) checks sign-out, cancellation and
retry against an offline Claude CLI confined to a disposable home.

The [provider recovery recipe](provider-recovery.md) verifies real Grok image
transport and Claude authentication against loopback APIs, plus scoped thread
approvals and provider safety errors in an isolated desktop UI.

The [automatic recovery fixture](automatic-recovery.md) checks opt-in, one-shot
backup model dispatch after proven pre-prompt ACP failures, preserving the
conversation, approval level and Stop/new-message precedence.

The [skill approval lifecycle recipe](skill-approval-lifecycle.md) checks Deny,
missing staged records and active-thread deletion in two isolated app windows,
including the surviving conversation and sending again without deleting the bot.

sent mentions, multiline scrolling and responsive wrapping in real chat views.

The [Group and Goal Local VM recipe](group-local-vm.md) checks per-speaker
desktop routing, cancellation, and computer authority cleanup.

## Evidence

The [persistence responsiveness benchmark](persistence-performance.md) measures
synthetic message/log bursts and history scans, with isolated chat, visibility
and packaged-worker checks. It is not a production capacity qualification.

The [backup responsiveness benchmark](backup-responsiveness.md) compares in-process
and worker exports using synthetic data, with isolated backup workflow checks.

The [Japanese desktop font recipe](japanese-desktop.md) checks real Firefox and
XFCE glyph rendering in disposable managed desktops, including fresh recreation.

The [Podman Firefox sandbox recipe](podman-firefox.md) checks the capability set a
managed desktop keeps so Firefox can start, with before/after acceptance evidence.

The [Hetzner launch record](hetzner-launch-2026-09-07.md) is a dated self-hosting
run on a disposable VPS: what passed, what was corrected, and what it does not prove.

Keep the JSON from `wait` and `messages`, the exact command sequence, and the
fixture's printed log path. Evidence must show both the action and the resulting
state. A green unit test alone does not prove a user workflow.

## Cleanup

Interrupt the `launch` process with Ctrl-C. It stops the exact child it owns and
removes only its temporary data directory. The server log remains at the
printed path. Never kill processes by name and never delete a broad temp root.
