# Qwen model selection

The Qwen picker reads configured chat routes from the server user's
`.qwen/settings.json`. It preserves protocol and endpoint identity; no endpoint,
credential, or environment-key name is exposed in the public model catalog.

later.dog uses Qwen's native ACP model selector and requires the CLI to confirm the
selected route before sending the prompt. It does not pass a bare `-m` argument,
which would retain the saved provider. This requires a Qwen Code version that
supports `session/set_config_option` for `model`. Unsupported versions fail before
prompting; update Qwen Code using its official installer and refresh models.

Offline verification (no provider login or paid calls):

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/drivers/acp/qwen-catalog.test.ts server/drivers/local-inject.test.ts server/drivers/local-inject-matrix.test.ts server/drivers/acp/acp.test.ts server/drivers/acp/approval-matrix.test.ts server/drivers/acp/opencode-go.test.ts
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/verify-qwen-models.ts
```

The script owns a disposable server through the standard launcher, installs a
synthetic Qwen CLI only in that temporary home, selects another provider and
another endpoint, and verifies the ACP calls precede the prompt. An acknowledged
but unchanged selection must not send a prompt.

The synthetic CLI also reproduces Qwen's live-session cache: `session/load`
acknowledges the request while retaining the original MCP credentials. The
fixture calls the real agents proxy's `list_bots` and `session_search` tools on
three turns on one conversation. later.dog keeps the agents bearer across turns
while the grants are unchanged, so Qwen keeps one child and its live session.
The pid stays the same; the aggregate RPC log contains one `initialize`, one
`session/new`, no `session/load`, and three `session/prompt` calls. The process
confirms the selected endpoint before its first prompt, and each turn's
credential returns HTTP 401 once the turn settles. The ACP unit checks
separately cover a fresh Qwen process when its MCP configuration changes,
process reuse when it is unchanged, and same-process reloads for engines that
support them. JSON includes resulting messages and the
launcher's persistent log path. The server and temporary home are cleaned up
on completion. This proves later.dog's integration contract, not real provider auth
or a paid model response.

Last exercised: 2026-10-04, isolated macOS fixture. All three turns settled
with six successful roster calls, three history searches, one process id, one
agents bearer, and three HTTP 401 checks after the turns settled. The
alternate-provider, alternate-endpoint, and rejected-switch checks also passed.
No live provider or user workspace was used.

Route identity follows Qwen Code's
[ACP model utility](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/packages/cli/src/utils/acpModelUtils.ts)
and [model registry](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/packages/core/src/models/modelRegistry.ts).
Invalid or indistinguishable routes fail explicitly rather than using a saved
provider. Legacy bare model IDs resolve only when exactly one configured route
matches. Live local models replace only the matching endpoint, not cloud models
with the same name.
