// off for this bot, and "read" refuses anything that is not a read.
//
// Shared between the harness (which enforces it at the connector relay,
// seeing through Composio's meta tools) and the app (which shows the
// control), so both agree on what a scope means.
// No import from outbound.ts: shared/ is compiled by both the server (which
// needs .ts extensions) and the app (which forbids them), so shared modules
// stand alone. The read-verb rule is repeated here in its Composio-only form.
