# Behavior evals

Offline behavior evals for the later.dog harness (tiers 1-3). The unit and e2e suite tests code paths; these scenarios test what the harness *does*: which tools a turn's model was allowed to call, where work was dispatched, what the handoff tree looks like, how routines defer, and when the computer claim fires.

The principle: evaluate the harness, never the models. A scripted engine replays deterministic turns (tool calls, text, refusals) from a plan file; no external API is called; a run is hermetic and repeatable.

## Run

    pnpm eval                     # all scenarios, JSON + markdown report under evals/reports/runs/
    pnpm eval --scenario lazy-computer-claim
    pnpm eval --golden            # tier 2: replay redacted golden threads against committed trace baselines
    pnpm eval --live              # tier 3: opt-in live-model smoke (skips unless LATERDOG_EVAL_LIVE=1)
    pnpm typecheck && pnpm exec tsc -p evals/tsconfig.json   # evals are also typechecked standalone
    npx vitest run --config evals/vitest.config.ts   # the same scenarios as a test gate

## Layout

- `scenarios/` — fixture files, one JSON per scenario. Pure data: bots, scripted turns, driver steps, assertions.
- `providers/mock/` — the deterministic scripted engine: builds the plan the fake provider replays turn by turn, with `@key` bot references resolved to live ids.
- `runners/` — boots a real harness server per world (scripted coordination server; Local VM fixture world), interprets steps, freezes the evidence.
- `scorers/` — pure assertion evaluation against the frozen snapshot; scorers never touch a server.
- `reports/` — per-run JSON and markdown artifacts (gitignored).
- `golden/` — tier 2: the redaction pipeline (raw samples in, synthetic scenarios out), behavior-trace extraction, and replay against committed trace baselines.
- `live/` — tier 3: opt-in live-model smoke scenarios, thresholds, and reporting; live baselines are gitignored.

## Scenario anatomy

Each fixture declares a `world`, the `bots` to create with their scripted `turns`, optional gate names (files that hold a turn open, for deterministic busy windows), `steps` that drive the real server, and `assertions` checked against the frozen evidence. Assertions cover tool call sequences and arguments, dispatch targets, handoff tree shape, system prompts, routine deferral stamps, computer-gate answers, and transcript facts.

## Current pins

- `dispatch-supersede` — a message sent to an idle Chief while its coordinated work is outstanding runs immediately as its own turn (not steered into the dispatching turn, not queued behind the work), the assignment stays attached, and that turn is told which work is outstanding. (Current semantics: a new message is not a cancellation.)
- `routine-deferral` — a routine due behind a busy target is stamped `deferredAt` while staying queued, then dispatches and completes when the target frees.
- `lazy-claim-screenless` (issue #1361) — a screen-less Auto turn mounts computer tools without claiming the VM and completes while another thread holds it; no wait activity appears.
- `lazy-computer-claim` (issue #1361) — the first screen call fires the deferred claim, is honestly refused while another thread holds the VM, shows the existing wait activity, and proceeds on release.
- `lazy-claim-rejection` (issue #1369) — a VM that dies between dispatch and the first screen call rejects the fired claim: the call is refused honestly instead of as contention, exactly one terminal computer-unavailable error lands, the turn ends instead of staying busy, and a later screen call fails closed after teardown revokes the bridge capability.

## Worlds

- `coordination` — the packaged verification server with the scripted room engine: ordinary chat, `coordinate_bots` handoffs, routines.
- `localVm` — the real server with the container boundary replaced by the in-repo VM fixture (`server/testing/group-local-vm-hooks.mjs`): hermetic Local VM lifecycle, no Podman. The runner plays the bridge's computer-control poll, which is the seam the lazy claim lives at.

## Tier 2 — golden-thread replay

Turn a real coordination thread into a synthetic fixture, then replay it through the scripted engine:

    node --experimental-strip-types evals/golden/redact/redact-cli.ts \
        --input evals/golden/samples/<raw-thread>.json \
        --out evals/golden/scenarios/golden-<name>.json
    pnpm eval --golden --update-baseline --scenario golden-<name>

The redaction step rewrites ids, names, and free text into stable synthetic placeholders and runs a leak scan before writing anything, so a real thread becomes reviewable, committable data. Commit both the redacted scenario and the regenerated baseline under `evals/golden/baselines/`; replay asserts the stable tool traces and outcomes — turn order, tool-call names, dispatch targets, handoff-tree shape — against that baseline.

## Tier 3 — opt-in live-model smoke

Live-model runs never execute by default: `pnpm eval --live` prints one skip line and exits 0 unless the gate is open.

    LATERDOG_EVAL_LIVE=1 LATERDOG_EVAL_LIVE_CONFIG=/path/to/instance.json pnpm eval --live

The instance file (or inline `LATERDOG_EVAL_LIVE_INSTANCE` JSON) uses the product's own instance shape — `instanceId`, `driver`, `model`, optional `config` and `environmentFrom` — so credential variables are copied from the launching shell (`LATERDOG_EVAL_LIVE_PASS_ENV` lists names to forward) and never inlined. Thresholds live in the committed `evals/live/config.json`: minimum suite score, maximum drift from the last recorded baseline, and turn and judge timeouts. Scenarios run cheap real models with state-based waits, deterministic checks (`botReplied`, tool traces), and a versioned judge whose prompt files are pinned by sha256 in a manifest; drift against the gitignored `evals/live/baselines/` baseline fails the suite.

## Skill bench (alpha)

The skill bench measures one fixture skill against its own prompts through the same scripted machinery as tier 1. Each prompt runs twice — with the skill installed as a user skill under the booted server's data dir and without it — so the contrast covers the real seams: trigger-term selection, the `<laterdog-skill>` block riding the system prompt, and the scripted follower's behavior against a no-skill baseline. It evaluates the harness, never a model.

    node --experimental-strip-types evals/runners/run-skill-bench.ts [--fixture bench-triage-handoff] [--replicates 2]

The alpha report gives per-arm pass rates, duration and estimated tokens (chars/4 over evidence turns; the scripted provider makes no API calls) with mean and standard deviation, a delta-per-assertion table, and two flags: non-discriminating assertions (identical verdicts in both arms — controls, not effects) and high-variance assertions (verdicts that flip across replicates of the same prompt and arm, assessable from two replicates on). `evals/skill-bench/fixtures/` holds bench fixtures; `evals/skill-bench/triggers/` holds the trigger-eval sets (should-trigger / should-not-trigger with train and held-out splits, plus near misses) that a later router slice validates against — data only, no router code.
