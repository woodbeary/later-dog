// Privileged capabilities — camera/video, geolocation, USB, HID, serial,
// MIDI, unguarded screen capture, window management, local fonts — stay off: the app
// does not use them, and granting them unconditionally to the renderer leaves
// host sensors and devices exposed if an untrusted payload ever executes.
// The allow-list also applies only to the verified renderer origin; any
// opaque or cross-origin request is refused outright.
//
// One exception: the person's own Cloud, open in the main window, may use the
// microphone (for a Live call) and write the clipboard (its copy buttons), and
// nothing else. A Cloud is personal, so its page hearing the microphone is the
// person's own page hearing it. Any other server's page stays refused.
//
// A second, separate exception: the paired remote server open in the main
// window may write the clipboard (the copy button) and nothing else. Both
// clipboard writes follow the one rule in remoteClipboardWriteAllowed.
